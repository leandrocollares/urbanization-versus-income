# Urbanization versus income

A responsive scatter plot implemented with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [D3](https://d3js.org/) that shows
urban population percentages and GDP per capita in Americas.

[Crosshairs](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/crosshairs) display said indicators when points are hovered over.

This project was bootstrapped with the [Svelte app template](https://github.com/sveltejs/template).
